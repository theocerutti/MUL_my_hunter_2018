# My_Hunter

MyHunter is my first project with CSFML library.
The goal of this game is to have the best score.
To have the best score you must kill all the fishes on the screen (by left clicking on them).
/!\ If fishes exit the screen you will loose a life. You have 3 lives. If you don't have life it's a Game Over.
